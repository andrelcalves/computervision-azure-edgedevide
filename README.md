# Azure Cognite Services or Azure AI Services
Computer Vision - Azure Cognite Services

The Azure Cognite Service has been renamed for *Azure AI Services*, this suite is a powerful set of tools that you can use to build your AI solutions and get to the market as fast as possible.

The cognite services has API that is pre-trained.

Focus on Computer Vision we can use the Cloud API services to:

* OCR (Text extraction) , extract text for invoices for instance.
* Image understanding, extract object (object detection), spacial analysis
* Facial recognition.
